<p>Smart Insurance Collection(SIC) is for insurance agents who <strong>prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts and appointments</strong>. More importantly, SIC is <strong>optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface</strong> (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).</p>

<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: added <strong>Predict Command</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: It predicts the potential spending of a new customer based on the information from the
existing customers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: A insurance agents can have hundreds of potential customers. It would be very handy and essential for
them to have a heuristics to rank the customers by priority. One obvious factor is how much the customer would spend on
the insurance. Based on this, a "predict" command would be very useful to predict how much a potential customers
will spend. Therefore the insurance agents can prioritise visiting those customers who are likely to spend more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This features requires a lot of foundational enhancements from other parts of the application. The original
address book does not come with the features to encode the information needed for the calculation. Hence I need to
add in more features in order to develop this feature. In the process, I have made enhancements to every components from
storage to the UI.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Predict the potential spending of the of a new customer. Some of the customers have
their "actual spending" recorded down while some don&#8217;t have because they have
not spent anything yet on the insurance policy. Hence this command is to
predict how much they will spend based on the information from the existing customers</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Examples:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Initially</code><br>
two customers with <code>actualSpending</code> &gt; 0 while the other with
<code>actualSpending</code> == 0(actual spending will actually not be shown
if it is zero).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>After</code><br>
The customer with <code>actualSpending</code> == 0 now has <code>expectedSpending</code> shown.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other Specification:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The solution is persistent. Hence when new users are added and old users are deleted,
the new solutions are calculated incrementally from the old solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When adding an new <code>Person</code>, the <code>/as</code>(Actual Spending) is optional.
if the actual spending is specified, the person is considered as existing
customer. Otherwise potential customer. The prediction is to predict
the potential customer&#8217;s spending based on the information on the
existing customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The solution is calculated through numerical methods. And numerical methods,
unlike Jesus, can&#8217;t solve everything. There are certain inputs that will lead
to divergent solution. Also, certain value might be too large to be captured
even with double. Hence in situations like this, an message of "Divergent solution"
would be presented with no prediction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like "help" command, the design is fault-tolerant. If you type extra text such
as <code>predict abcde</code> or <code>predict nothing please</code>, those are not valid command since
<code>predict</code> takes no other argument. But they will still be accepted as <code>predict</code></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A command by the keyword of "predict" is added. It takes no argument.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Function</code> : Customers in the list may or may not have
"actual spending" entered. Because at the point in time,
the customer has not purchased any policy at all.
Hence it would be convenient to have a way to predict the
likely amount of purchase they would make so that the
insurance agent can prioritize those customers with higher
likelihood to spend more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Implementation</code> : Each customer&#8217;s data would be extracted as a row.
The column represents. Each Targeted fields such as income, age and so on.
The model used here is linear regression. That means we assume the purchase made
by the customer is a linear combination of all the targeted fields.
This model is not perfect. However for the first version of this
function, we will just use this model. These data would form a matrix.
Imaging a form of Ax=b where A is a matrix and x is a vector of weights
and b is the expected outcome. The name of the game is to find the
weights that minimises the loss of the objective function A.
The numerical solver used here is Stochastic Gradient Descent.
